# When the workspace function is called with no parameters, it will
# look for the file ~/.azureml/settings.json and extract the workspace
# id, authorization # token, api endpoint, and management endpoint
# from the # file. Otherwise you # must pass these values as parameters
# to the workspace function. You can find your workspace id in Azure
# machine learing by selecting 
#
#   settings -> name -> workspace id
#
# and the authorization token by selecting
#
#   settings > authorization tokens -> primary authorization token
