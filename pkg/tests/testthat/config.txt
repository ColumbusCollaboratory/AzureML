To run the unit tests, you have to supply some Azure ML Studio keys.

To to this, copy the snippet of JSON below to a file called "config.json"
and put this in the same folder as the unit tests. Then edit the file to
contain your own test key values.

{
"workspace_id": ["Add your workspace id here"],
"authorization_token": ["Add your authorization token here"],
"exp_id" : ["Add your experiment id here"],
"node_id" : ["Add your node id here"]
}
